# Difference betweem SQLite and MySQL

* **Architecture**: SQLite is a serverless, file-based database system, while MySQL is a client-server system that requires a separate server process.

* **Scalability**: SQLite is suitable for small to medium-sized applications, while MySQL is better suited for large-scale applications with many concurrent users.

* **Performance**: SQLite is faster than MySQL for simple operations, but MySQL is faster for complex queries and large-scale data sets.

* **Transactions**: SQLite supports only one writer at a time and provides limited support for transactions, while MySQL supports multiple writers and provides full support for transactions.

* **Compatibility**: SQLite is compatible with most operating systems and programming languages, while MySQL is primarily designed for use with Linux/Unix-based systems and is often used with PHP.

* **Licensing**: SQLite is free and open source, while MySQL is available in both open source and commercial versions.

* **Concurrency**: SQLite is not well-suited for highly concurrent workloads, as it locks the entire database when one process is writing. MySQL can handle higher levels of concurrency.

* **Data types**: SQLite has a more limited set of data types than MySQL, and does not support some advanced features such as stored procedures and triggers.

* **Administration**: MySQL provides more advanced administrative features, such as user management, database backup and recovery, and performance tuning.

* **Use cases**: SQLite is often used for embedded systems, mobile apps, and small-scale web applications, while MySQL is commonly used for larger web applications, e-commerce sites, and data warehousing.
